# UCSD_Text_Editor
A Java GUI based text editor using specialized data structures to implement spell check, word completion, Markov text generation, and Flesch score (readability of text).

<b>1. Spell Check</b>
<p>Uses a Trie data structure that allows for spellcheck prediction by going through the word's path see if it exists.</p>

<b>2. Word Completion </b>
<p>Uses the Trie data structure to find available paths that are valid words.</p>

<b>3. Markov text Generation </b>
<p>Uses the probablity of next works to randomly generate sentences</p>

<b>4. Flesch score </b>
<p>Uses a formula to calculate the readilbity of a text. Formula be found https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fleschâ€“Kincaid_readability_tests</p>
